# TensorFlow-Exam-Sourcebok
A compilation of important concepts, processes, and code snippets assembled while preparing to take the TensorFlow Professional Developer Exam

The Jupyter Notebook included in this repository is a compilation of notes about different terms, topics, processes, and techniques related to the skills and knowledge that are tested on in the TensorFlow Developer Exam. It contains text explanations, pseudo-code, and specific code snippets throughout the file depending on the context.

I originally compiled this notebook for my own self-study, but I encourge anyone who finds value in it to use it for their own studies as they see fit. Please note: this notebook is by no means comprehensive and will not guarantee passing the exam - it is simply a compilation of things I've found helpful across various ML problems and applications. Do your own research.

The Table of Contents is as follows:

[ Section 1 ]

(1) Basic Neural Net Regression
(2) Basic Neural Net Classification
(3) Convolutional Neural Networks
(4) Transfer Learning - Feature Extraction
(5) Transfer Learning - Fine-Tuning
(6) Natural Language Processing
(7) Time Series - Compiled Process (from 2 different examples)

[ Section 2 ]

- Save models in various formats
- Plotting loss & accuracy
- Preventing overfitting
- Data augmentation
- Dropout
- Batch loading of data
- Callbacks
- Dataset formats (JSON, CSV, etc.)
- Dynamically adjusting learning rates
- Visualization of various clf + other metrics
- Making a dataset performant using tf.data API
- Creating ensemble models
- Accounting for horizon variance in time series prediction
- Plotting prediction intervals

[ Section 3 ]

Vocabulary terms can be found in bold throughout the notebook and are listed at the end of the notebook in alphabetical order with a bried definition and/or description (see the notebook for specifics).
